Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.networking.azurerm_resource_group.labs-rg will be created
  + resource "azurerm_resource_group" "labs-rg" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + location = "northeurope"
      + name     = "labs-rg"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
